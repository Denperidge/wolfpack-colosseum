# Wolfpack Coloseum
A joke website to test out Firebase!

## Read before running!
Could still be run if you really wanted to, albeit with some reconfiguration and updating firebase & dependencies
(due to **security vulnerabilities** from the package versions used at the time.
See the closed, non-merged dependabot commits [github.com/Denperidge/wolfpack-colosseum/pulls](https://github.com/Denperidge/wolfpack-colosseum/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed))
